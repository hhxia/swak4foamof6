Script=${0##*/}
VER=5.0

usage () {
    exec 1>&2
    while [ "$#" -ge 1 ]; do echo "$1"; shift; done
    cat <<USAGE

Usage: ${0##*/} [OPTIONS]
options:
  -d | -dir            host directory mounted (defaults to current directory)
  -b | -build          Build container from local DockerFile (for testing)
  -x | -xhost          use custom X authority and give container host network
  -h | -help           help

Launches the OpenFOAM ${VER} Docker image.
- Requires installation of docker-engine.
- Runs a "containerized" bash shell environment where the user can run OpenFOAM
  and, optionally, ParaView (see below).
- The container mounts the user's file system so that case files are stored
  permanently.  The container mounts the current directory by default, but the
  user can also specify a particular directory using the "-d" option.
- Mounting the user's HOME directory is disallowed.
- The '-xhost' option is useful when accessing the host via 'ssh -X'.
  This option should only be used when strictly necessary, as it relies on the
  option '--net=host' when launching the container in Docker, which will
  give to the container full access to the Docker host network stack and
  potentially the host's system services that rely on network communication,
  making it potentially insecure.

Example:
To store data in ${HOME}/OpenFOAM/${USER}-${VER}, the user can launch
${Script} either by:
    cd ${HOME}/OpenFOAM/${USER}-${VER} && ${Script}
or
    ${Script} -d ${HOME}/OpenFOAM/${USER}-${VER}

Note:
The container user name appears as "openfoam" but it is just an alias.
